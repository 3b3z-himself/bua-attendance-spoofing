## Installation

### Chrome/Edge/Brave (Chromium-based browsers)

   - Edge: Navigate to `edge://extensions/`
   - Brave: Navigate to `brave://extensions/`

   - Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner

   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing the extension files (`bua-attendance-spoofing`)

4. **Pin the Extension** (Optional)
   - Click the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar

## Usage

1. **Click the extension icon** in your browser toolbar to open the popup

2. **Enable spoofing**:
   - Toggle the switch to "ON" (it will turn green)

3. **Set your location** using one of two methods:

   **Method A: Use a Preset Location**
   - Click "Load Preset" button
   - Select a location from the list

   **Method B: Enter Custom Coordinates**
   - Enter a location name (e.g., "My Office")
   - Enter latitude (e.g., 40.7128)
   - Enter longitude (e.g., -74.0060)
   - Optionally adjust accuracy in meters
   - Click "Save Location"

4. **Refresh any open web pages** to apply the new location

5. **Test it**:
   - Visit any website that uses geolocation (e.g., Google Maps, weather sites)
   - The site should now see your spoofed location

## How It Works

The extension uses a content script that runs on every webpage and overrides the browser's native `navigator.geolocation` API. When a website requests your location, the extension provides the fake coordinates you've set instead of your real location.

### Technical Details

- **Manifest Version**: 3 (latest Chrome extension format)
- **Permissions**: `storage`, `activeTab`, and access to all URLs
- **Content Script**: Injected at `document_start` to override geolocation before page scripts run
- **Storage**: Uses Chrome's `sync` storage to persist settings across devices
