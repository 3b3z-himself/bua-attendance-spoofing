# üì∑ Camera Overlay Feature

## Overview

The camera overlay feature allows you to overlay a custom photo on top of your camera feed. This works with any website that uses your camera, including video conferencing apps, online attendance systems, and more.

## Features

‚úÖ **Photo Upload** - Upload any image to use as an overlay  
‚úÖ **Camera Selection** - Choose which camera to use (if you have multiple)  
‚úÖ **Opacity Control** - Adjust the transparency of the overlay (0-100%)  
‚úÖ **Size Control** - Scale the overlay image (50-150%)  
‚úÖ **Position Control** - Place the overlay in different positions:
  - Center
  - Top Left
  - Top Right
  - Bottom Left
  - Bottom Right

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enable Camera Overlay

3. Toggle the "Camera Overlay" switch to **ON**

### Step 2: Upload a Photo

1. Click "Choose File" under "Upload Photo"
2. Select an image from your computer
3. The image preview will appear below
4. Your photo is now saved and ready to use

### Step 3: Configure Settings

**Opacity:**
- Drag the slider to adjust transparency
- 100% = Fully opaque (photo completely visible)
- 0% = Fully transparent (photo invisible)

- Drag the slider to scale the image
- 100% = Original relative size
- 150% = 1.5x larger
- 50% = Half size

**Position:**

### Step 4: Select Camera (Optional)

3. Click "Start Camera" to see the overlay in action

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The extension intercepts the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API call and:

1. Captures the original camera stream
2. Draws each video frame onto a canvas element
3. Overlays your uploaded photo on top
4. Returns the modified canvas stream instead of the original

This happens in real-time at approximately 30 FPS, providing a smooth video experience.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Photo

- **Transparent Background**: PNG images with transparent backgrounds work best
- **Face Photos**: For attendance, use a clear, front-facing photo
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution images provide better quality
- **File Size**: Keep images under 5MB for best performance

### Optimal Settings

**For Attendance Systems:**
- Opacity: 80-100%
- Size: 80-100%
- Position: Center

**For Video Calls:**
- Opacity: 30-60%
- Size: 50-80%
- Position: Bottom Right or Top Left

### Performance Tips

- Lower opacity values require less processing power
- Smaller overlay sizes improve performance
- Close unused browser tabs for smoother video

## Troubleshooting

### Photo Doesn't Appear

1. Make sure "Camera Overlay" toggle is **ON**
2. Verify you've uploaded a photo (check preview)
3. Refresh the webpage using the camera
4. Check opacity isn't set to 0%

### Camera Not Working

1. Check browser camera permissions
2. Make sure no other app is using the camera
3. Try refreshing the camera list
4. Restart your browser

### Blurry or Pixelated Overlay

1. Upload a higher resolution image
2. Reduce the overlay size setting
3. Try a different image format (PNG recommended)

### Performance Issues

1. Reduce overlay size to 70-80%
2. Use a smaller image file
3. Close other browser tabs
4. Try lowering the opacity

## Privacy & Security

### Data Storage

- Photos are stored locally in Chrome's sync storage
- No data is sent to external servers
- Photos sync across your Chrome profile (if sync is enabled)

### Removing Data

To remove all camera overlay data:

1. Click "Remove Photo" in the extension popup
2. Or disable the extension
3. Or clear extension data from Chrome settings

### Permissions

The extension requires:
- `storage`: To save your settings and photos
- `activeTab`: To inject the overlay script
- `<all_urls>`: To work on all websites (you control where it activates)

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Positioning with Aspect Ratios

For precise control, choose image dimensions that match your camera's aspect ratio:
- 16:9 cameras: 1920x1080 or 1280x720 images
- 4:3 cameras: 1024x768 or 640x480 images

### Multiple Profiles

To use different overlays for different purposes:
1. Use Chrome's profile feature
2. Create separate profiles for work, personal, etc.
3. Configure different overlays in each profile

### Testing Before Use

Always test your overlay configuration:
1. Use the built-in camera test page
2. Verify position, size, and opacity
3. Make sure the photo appears as intended
4. Then use on your target website
