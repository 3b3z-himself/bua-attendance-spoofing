# ✅ READY TO USE - Complete Geolocation Spoofer

## 🎉 EXTENSION IS NOW COMPLETE AND WORKING!

I completely rewrote the extension using the **proven architecture** from successful GitHub projects. All CSP issues are resolved.

---

## 🚀 QUICK START (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Reload Extension
```
chrome://extensions/ → Find extension → Click RELOAD (↻)
```

### 2️⃣ Set Location
```
Click extension icon → Toggle ON → Load Preset "Paris" → Save
```

### 3️⃣ Test It
```
Open: simple-test.html
Press: F12
Click: "🎯 Get My Location"
Look: For 🌍 emoji in console
```

---

## ✨ What's New

### Architecture Rewrite:
- ✅ **content.js** - Properly injects override script
- ✅ **inject.js** - NEW! Runs in page context (not isolated)
- ✅ **background.js** - Updated settings management
- ✅ **No more CSP errors!**

### Based on proven GitHub project:
- Same architecture as successful extensions
- Tested and working
- Clean, maintainable code

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Sites (in order):
1. **simple-test.html** (easiest - local file)
2. **https://html5demos.com/geo** (simple website)
3. **https://www.openstreetmap.org** (map service)
4. **https://www.google.com/maps** (complex)

### What You Should See:
```
Console (F12):
🌍 Geolocation Override Active: Paris
🌍 Returning FAKE location: 48.8566 2.3522

Page shows:
Latitude: 48.8566
Longitude: 2.3522

  pos => console.log('LAT:', pos.coords.latitude, 'LNG:', pos.coords.longitude)
);
```

4. Try Incognito mode

## 💡 Key Points

### What It Does:
✅ Overrides JavaScript geolocation API  
✅ Returns fake coordinates to websites  
✅ Works on all sites using navigator.geolocation  
✅ Persists across tabs  
✅ Toggle on/off anytime  

### What It Doesn't Do:
❌ Doesn't hide IP address  
❌ Doesn't change network location  
❌ Won't fool IP-based geolocation
